# 🛠️ ETL Data Processing Pipeline

This repository contains a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook demonstrates a complete data workflow that reads raw data, processes it, and prepares it for downstream analysis or reporting.

## 📌 Overview

This project showcases a structured ETL process using Python. The dataset includes customer purchase data with fields such as customer ID, age, gender, item purchased, category, purchase amount, and location. The notebook handles the following:

- **Extraction**: Loading data from a raw source (e.g., CSV or Excel).
- **Transformation**: Data cleaning, formatting, filtering, and summarization.
- **Loading**: Exporting the processed data into a new format for further use.

The pipeline is useful for business analytics, sales trend analysis, and preparing clean datasets for machine learning or reporting dashboards.
